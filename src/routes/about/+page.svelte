			<p class="section-mb-sm">In our current V1 form, we focus on nailing the mirroring and piecing together of tribal communication across your organization.</p>
			
			<p class="section-mb-sm">In V2, Sentra will automate away more busywork. We're building the autopilot for work, for everyone in the company. This involves integrating with all knowledge connectors like Google Drive and adding more proactive, autonomous features.</p>
			
			<p class="section-mb-sm">Imagine Sentra extracting relevant documents for your review when you mention sending materials in a meeting. Or having Sentra attend certain meetings for you, developing its own voice while keeping you in the zone without missing anything important.</p>
			
			<p class="section-mb-sm">Sentra becomes your ally during performance reviews, helping you make your case by understanding contributions beyond codeâ€”how you spoke up in meetings and discussions. It's designed to help everyone, not judge them.</p>
			
			<p>Ultimately, Sentra becomes the cultural human glue that maintains startup ethos while companies scale. Run a large company at the speed of a small company.</p>

				<p>We believe AI will evolve through distinct levels of capability and autonomy. Starting from basic chat assistants like ChatGPT that save seconds of cognitive friction, moving through task agents that automate specific workflows, to role agents that can replace entire functions.</p>
				
				<p>Sentra represents the next evolution: goal agents that work towards continuous business mandates like alignment, compliance, and satisfaction. This is a new class of AI that impacts the whole organization, not just individual tasks or teams.</p>
				
				<p>Eventually, we envision high autonomy goal agents where humans are no longer in the decision-making loop, and ultimately full automation where AI independently manages complex organizational tasks without any human intervention.</p>
				
				<p>We're building towards this future, starting with organizational alignment as the foundation for autonomous organizational intelligence.</p>
