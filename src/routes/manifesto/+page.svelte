				<!-- Principle 1 -->
				<div class="">
					<h2 class="text-title2 text-foreground mb-6 flex items-center">
						Alignment <IconChevronRight class="mx-1 size-6" /> surveillance
					</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						The future isn't asking how much more you can extract. It's asking how much faster you
						can course-correct. Surveillance is brittle. Alignment is adaptive. We're here to help
						teams move as one without losing themselves.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Principle 2 -->
				<div class="">
					<h2 class="text-title2 text-foreground mb-6 flex items-center">
						Dialogue<IconChevronRight class="mx-1 size-6" />dashboards
					</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						Humans weren't made for endless charts and checklists. They were made to talk. Ask.
						Reflect. Shift. Sentra speaks in the cadence of conversation because alignment begins
						with listening, not measuring.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Principle 3 -->
				<div class="">
					<h2 class="text-title2 text-foreground mb-6 flex items-center">
						Coherence<IconChevronRight class="mx-1 size-6" />control
					</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						The best systems don't control. They adapt. Sentra helps your company reflect in
						real-time so trust scales as fast as speed. A coherent org doesn't micromanage—it steers
						from clarity.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Principle 4 -->
				<div class="">
					<h2 class="text-title2 text-foreground mb-6">Systems don't have to watch to help</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						Sentra was built on a simple truth: people want to do good work. They don't need to be
						watched. They need context, clarity, and connection. We built a new species of software
						to offer just that.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Principle 5 -->
				<div class="">
					<h2 class="text-title2 text-foreground mb-6">Misalignment is silent. We aren't.</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						Sentra spots the slip before the gap widens. And engages just enough to get the right
						people back on the same page—early. Because silence is the costliest overhead of all.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Principle 6 -->
				<div class="">
					<h2 class="text-title2 text-foreground mb-6">Every check-in builds trust</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						The more you talk to Sentra, the deeper its sense-making—not surveillance—becomes. A
						real teammate doesn't log hours. They just know when to nudge. That's the kind of AI
						we're building.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Closing Statement -->
				<div class="section-pt-sm">
					<div class="border-border border-t pt-12">
						<p class="text-callout text-muted-foreground mx-auto">
							Every company needs a memory. A pulse. A quiet current that keeps the system steady.<br
							/>
							That's what we're building. One check-in at a time.
