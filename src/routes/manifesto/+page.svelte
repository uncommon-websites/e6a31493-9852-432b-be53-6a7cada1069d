				<p class="text-foreground">
					We're at a moment when technology stands at a crossroads. One path leads toward
					surveillance, extraction, and control. The other toward alignment, trust, and human
					flourishing.
				</p>

				<p class="text-foreground">We choose the second path.</p>

				<p class="text-foreground">
					For too long, we've accepted that growth requires watching. That scale demands
					surveillance. That the price of coordination is the erosion of trust. We reject this false
					choice.
				</p>

				<p class="text-foreground">
					<strong>Alignment over surveillance.</strong> The future isn't asking how much more you can
					extract. It's asking how much faster you can course-correct. Surveillance is brittle. Alignment
					is adaptive. We're here to help teams move as one without losing themselves.
				</p>

				<p class="text-foreground">
					<strong>Dialogue over dashboards.</strong> Humans weren't made for endless charts and checklists.
					They were made to talk. Ask. Reflect. Shift. Sentra speaks in the cadence of conversation because
					alignment begins with listening, not measuring.
				</p>

				<p class="text-foreground">
					<strong>Coherence over control.</strong> The best systems don't control. They adapt. Sentra
					helps your company reflect in real-time so trust scales as fast as speed. A coherent organization
					doesn't micromanage—it steers from clarity.
				</p>

				<p class="text-foreground">
					We built Sentra on a simple truth: people want to do good work. They don't need to be
					watched. They need context, clarity, and connection. We built a new species of software to
					offer just that.
				</p>

				<p class="text-foreground">
					Misalignment is silent. We aren't. Sentra spots the slip before the gap widens. And
					engages just enough to get the right people back on the same page—early. Because silence
					is the costliest overhead of all.
				</p>

				<p class="text-foreground">
					Every check-in builds trust. The more you talk to Sentra, the deeper its sense-making—not
					surveillance—becomes. A real teammate doesn't log hours. They just know when to nudge.
					That's the kind of AI we're building.
				</p>

				<p class="text-foreground">
					Every company needs a memory. A pulse. A quiet current that keeps the system steady.
					That's what we're building. One check-in at a time.
				</p>

				<p class="text-foreground">
					This is our manifesto. This is our promise. This is the new contract between humans and
					technology.
