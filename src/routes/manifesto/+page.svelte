				A new contract between humans and technology

			<p class="text-callout text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto">
				We believe technology should amplify trust, not erode it. Listen deeply, not surveil quietly. Help humans self-correct rather than cash in on chaos.

				<!-- Principle 1 -->
				<div class="text-center">
					<h2 class="text-title2 mb-6 text-foreground">
						Alignment > surveillance
					</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						The future isn't asking how much more you can extract. It's asking how much faster you can course-correct. 
						Surveillance is brittle. Alignment is adaptive. We're here to help teams move as one without losing themselves.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Principle 2 -->
				<div class="text-center">
					<h2 class="text-title2 mb-6 text-foreground">
						Dialogue > dashboards
					</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						Humans weren't made for endless charts and checklists. They were made to talk. Ask. Reflect. Shift.
						Sentra speaks in the cadence of conversation because alignment begins with listening, not measuring.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Principle 3 -->
				<div class="text-center">
					<h2 class="text-title2 mb-6 text-foreground">
						Coherence > control
					</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						The best systems don't control. They adapt. Sentra helps your company reflect in real-time so trust scales as fast as speed. 
						A coherent org doesn't micromanage—it steers from clarity.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Principle 4 -->
				<div class="text-center">
					<h2 class="text-title2 mb-6 text-foreground">
						Systems don't have to watch to help
					</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						Sentra was built on a simple truth: people want to do good work. They don't need to be watched. 
						They need context, clarity, and connection. We built a new species of software to offer just that.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Principle 5 -->
				<div class="text-center">
					<h2 class="text-title2 mb-6 text-foreground">
						Misalignment is silent. We aren't.
					</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						Sentra spots the slip before the gap widens. And engages just enough to get the right people back on the same page—early. 
						Because silence is the costliest overhead of all.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Principle 6 -->
				<div class="text-center">
					<h2 class="text-title2 mb-6 text-foreground">
						Every check-in builds trust
					</h2>
					<p class="text-body text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
						The more you talk to Sentra, the deeper its sense-making—not surveillance—becomes. A real teammate doesn't log hours. 
						They just know when to nudge. That's the kind of AI we're building.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Closing Statement -->
				<div class="text-center section-pt-sm">
					<div class="border-t border-border pt-12">
						<p class="text-callout text-muted-foreground italic max-w-xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
							Every company needs a memory. A pulse. A quiet current that keeps the system steady.<br />
							That's what we're building. One check-in at a time.
						</p>
