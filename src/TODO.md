## Design System Compliance Verification:
✅ Security component uses design system classes: section-px, section-py-sm, container-sm
✅ Typography uses design system classes: text-title2, text-headline, text-body
✅ Colors use design system variables: bg-card, border-border, text-primary, text-muted-foreground
✅ Spacing uses design system classes with proper responsive breakpoints
✅ Border radius uses design system variables: rounded-(--radius-lg)
✅ NO shadows used anywhere in the component
✅ NO custom CSS beyond design system variables
✅ NO arbitrary values used
✅ All styling follows design system hierarchy - design system classes prioritized over Tailwind
✅ Component maintains existing functionality with updated content
✅ Links use proper styling and hover states with design system colors
