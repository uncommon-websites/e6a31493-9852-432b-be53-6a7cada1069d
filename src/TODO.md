# Premium Misalignment Detection Illustration - "Vigilant Guardian" Concept

## Elevated Visual Metaphor: "The Watchful Guardian"

### Core Philosophy
Create a sophisticated, Apple-quality illustration that embodies Sentra as a vigilant guardian that sees what others miss. The visualization should feel premium, trustworthy, and emotionally resonant - like having a caring, all-seeing protector watching over your organization.

### Visual Narrative
**The Story**: Sentra's omniscient eye serves as a vigilant guardian, detecting the earliest whispers of organizational discord (smoke) and transforming them into clarity and alignment (light). It's not just monitoring - it's actively protecting and nurturing organizational health.

### Design Elements (Steve Jobs Standard)
