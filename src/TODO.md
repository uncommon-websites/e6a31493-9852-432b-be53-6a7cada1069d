## Design System Compliance Verification:
✅ All sections use design system classes: section-px, section-py, section-py-sm, container-sm
✅ Typography uses design system classes: text-display, text-title1, text-title2, text-title3, text-headline, text-body, text-caption
✅ Colors use design system variables: text-muted-foreground, bg-background, bg-primary/10, text-primary, border-border
✅ Spacing uses design system classes and proper responsive breakpoints
✅ Border radius uses design system variables: var(--radius-lg), var(--radius-md)
✅ NO shadows used anywhere in the modifications
✅ NO custom CSS beyond design system variables
✅ NO arbitrary values used (no [20px] or similar)
✅ All styling follows design system hierarchy - design system classes prioritized over Tailwind
✅ Removed all card backgrounds and borders to achieve cleaner, less boxy appearance
✅ Changed all text alignment from center to left throughout the page
✅ Maintained consistent background (bg-background) throughout, removed alternating bg-card sections
