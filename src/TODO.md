# Security Page

Let’s replace this page with a “Private Deployments” page.

The current trust center can be more or less replaced with what we have here https://trust.delve.co/sentra

This page should just have 3 sections

Section 1:

Should look similar to our hero with left/right column.

H1: Private Deployments

H2: Deploy Sentra privately for ultimate security and data sovereignty.

Button: Talk to Sales (should scroll down to section 3)

Graphic: Something that shows how Sentra’s memory/data models are protected within a cloud/ring/barrier from external environment

Section 2: Something like this (similar to Cohere, take inspiration from attached image 1)
H1: Sentra’s Organizational Intelligence \n without exposure risks

H2: Same as image

2 Cards:

- Completely private
  - All of Sentra’s memories and interactions occur within your secure infrastructure. Your sensitive company data never leaves your dedicated systems.
- Fully customizable
  - Customize the level of privacy with a dedicated solutions engineer.

Section 3: Contact Form, Something like this (inspired by https://cohere.com/private-deployments (attached image 2, the pinkish one))
