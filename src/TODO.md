# Task: Clean Up BenefitCard Component - Make it Minimal and Clean

## User Feedback: "This looks way too busy and ugly. make it clean, simple and do not use any curves. it's way too noisy. it should be minimal and clean and tell the story of the card content"

### Current Issues
- Complex animations with multiple pulse, ping, and spin effects
- Elaborate SVG visualizations with gradients and complex paths
- Multiple overlapping visual elements creating noise
- Curved borders (border-radius) that user specifically doesn't want
- Too many decorative elements that don't serve the content story

### Simplification Tasks
- [x] Remove all curved borders (border-radius) - use sharp corners
- [x] Simplify visibility visualization - remove complex concentric circles
- [x] Simplify misalignment visualization - remove complex SVG and animations
- [x] Simplify onboarding visualization - clean geometric approach
- [x] Simplify meetings visualization - remove radar complexity
- [x] Remove excessive animations (pulse, ping, spin effects)
- [x] Focus on clean typography and content hierarchy
- [x] Use minimal color palette
- [x] Ensure each visualization tells the core story simply
- [x] Test all visualization types work cleanly
- [x] Final design system compliance check - verify design system classes prioritized over Tailwind, NO shadows, NO custom CSS, NO arbitrary values, check theme.css, app.css and typography.css

### Design Philosophy
Make it look like something Apple would design - clean, purposeful, and elegant. Focus on the content story, not decorative noise.
